The Discovery cohort samples were divided into a training set and a validation set (7:3 division) based on the categorization of the samples when constructing the CNN model. After that, the 20 prediction results generated by the CNN model were combined and the data forms were preprocessed.
The initial RF model was constructed using all the results generated by the CNN model and the three gene mutation data obtained from genomic features screening. The variables were ranked according to MDA or MDG in the RF model importance, and the number of included variables was selected according to the five repetitions of the ten-fold cross-validation results, and the two were combined to include the variables to construct the new RF model. The new model was also constructed by incorporating the mutation data of the three genes obtained from the genomic features screening.

The above steps were repeated until the model was stabilized.
